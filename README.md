<img width="400" src=https://github.com/shosuke-13/MOTIVATE/blob/master/static/images/Motivate.PNG>

I created an app to visualize and manage motivation. You can post your progress and portfolio, and share them with others to objectively manage your own motivation. (This app was created as a team project after taking CS50.)

## How to Use

1. Sign up to create an account, then log in.
2. On the profile screen, you can edit your self-introduction, and change your registered email address and password.
3. On the motivation screen, you can register multiple motivational states and visualize them on a graph. You can also compare your own perceived state with your calculated true motivation state.
4. On the posting and portfolio screens, you can edit your posts and portfolio with images. You can also see a list of your past posts and portfolios.
5. On the home screen, you can see the latest posts and portfolios from everyone. Your edited posts and portfolios will also appear on the home screen.
6. Click on the logo of "MOTIVATE." at any time to see an explanation if you forget how to use the app.
7. Log out to log out and return to the login screen.
